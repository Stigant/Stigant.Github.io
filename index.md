## Publications

### Papers
`2021`
[Stigant,  Liam - The Augmented Base Locus in Mixed Characteristic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11980)
- *Submitted to Manuscripta Mathematica*
* Extends a famous result of Nakayame, that certain important geometric conditions correspond to numerical positivity conditions.

`2020`
[Stigant, Liam - On the Boundedness of Globally F-split Varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08123)
- *Submitted to Mathematische Zeitschrift*
* Establishes some boundedness results for a special class of varieties satisfying certain algebraic curvature conditions
* Such results are the subject of several important conjectures in birational geometry

`2018`
[Stigant, Liam, et al - Spatially adaptive linear precoding for systems beyond G.Fast](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8648147)
- *2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM). IEEE, 2018*
* Introduces a novel method for dealing with cable crosstalk on copper wires
* Compares the performance to existing methods

`2017`
[Darwin, Oscar, et al - Non-optimality of the Greedy Algorithm for subspace orderings in the method of alternating projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06144)
- *Results in Mathematics 72.1 (2017): 979-990*
* Shows that the optimal orderings of alternating projections problem is equivalent in general to Travelling Salesman Problem
* Shows that speed of convergence cannot be bounded below by any function of the pairwise angles

### Patents

`2018`
[Stigant, Liam , et al. Method and Apparatus for Transmitting Data in a Communication System](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&date=20190710&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP&CC=GB&NR=2569991A&KC=A&ND=5)
* Iterative method for vectored precoding of data to compensate for channel cross-talk
